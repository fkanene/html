<h2>Methods</h2>
     <!-- unorded list -->
<ul>   
<li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. 
    Butter two 20cm springform tins and line the bases with baking parchmentüí¶.</li>
<li>Beat the butter and both sugars in a bowl with an electric whisk for a few mins until lighter in 
    colour and fluffy.
     Add the vanilla and the eggs, one at a time, adding a spoonful of flour and beating in between each egg. 
     Add the remaining flour and milk. Divide between the cake tins and bake for 25-30 mins until they‚Äôre golden,
      spring back when pressed, 
     and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the middle. 
    Cool in the tins for a few mins, then tip out and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.üïë</li>

<li>Meanwhile, for the icing, put the butter and icing sugar in a bowl and whisk 
    for a few mins until light and airy. 
    Whisk in the caramel briefly, adding 1 tbsp of boiling water to loosen, 
    if needed. Set aside until the sponges are completely cool before assembling, or the icing will melt‚òÉÔ∏è.</li>
<li>Use half the icing to sandwich the cakes together, 
    then spread the remainder over the top, smoothing it out with a knife or the back of a spoon. 
    Leave in a cool place until ready to serve.üòç</li> 
<li>Drizzle with the 3 tbsp extra sauce (warm briefly in the microwave if it‚Äôs a little stiff ), 
    allowing some to drip down the sides if you like, and scatter over the toffee, 
    chocolate or caramel pieces to serve. Edible glitter, birthday candles or sparklers üçΩÔ∏è</li>
